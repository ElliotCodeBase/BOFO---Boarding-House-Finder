# BOFO Finder — Redesign Changelog (purple / professional)

> Note: these changes were written without compiling (no Java/Maven in the editing environment). Run the app once and use the troubleshooting guide below if anything misbehaves.

## What I did

**1. Theme: new professional purple (`bofo.css`, fully rewritten)**
- New palette: primary `#5B34B8`, dark `#3F2285`, tint `#F0EBFA`, background `#FAF9FC`, border `#E7E2F1`.
- Removed the amber accent. Purple is now the only brand color; gold `-bofo-gold` is used for rating stars only.
- Flatter look: cards use a 1px border instead of drop shadows; radii tightened (buttons/inputs 10, cards 12).
- Tags/badges are small rounded labels; hover states added on buttons, cards and the Google button.
- Floating mascot button is now white with a thin border and a soft purple shadow.
- All old variable names are kept (`-bofo-accent` now equals primary), so no screen breaks.

**2. Loading screen: white animated mascot (`SplashView.java`, rewritten; `Mascot.java` extended)**
- Flat deep-purple background with a WHITE BOFO mascot that jumps in a loop (squash, stretch, airtime, landing) with a ground shadow that shrinks and fades.
- "BOFO" wordmark, subtitle, three pulsing dots and a status line.
- Built from JavaFX shapes and a `Timeline` (no image files). Stops animating when the screen is removed.
- `Mascot` has a new constructor: `new Mascot(Expression.HAPPY, 150, true)` gives the white version (white body, deep-purple face). The old 2-argument constructor still gives the purple one.
- Splash minimum display time raised from 1.2 s to 2.2 s (`Main.java`) so the jump is actually seen.

**3. Smaller polish**
- `Nav.java`: every real screen fades in (260 ms); toast styled via CSS class.
- `Shell.java`: offline banner restyled (lavender, no amber).
- `BhCard.java`: emojis replaced with clean text tags (Water, Power, Wi-Fi, FEATURED, HOT, VERIFIED OWNER).
- `BofoPanel.java`: emojis removed from chat greeting text.
- `MapPane.java` and `VerificationView.java`: purple colors updated to the new palette; route line is dark purple.
- Status bar color (`Main.java`) set to `#3F2285` to match the splash.

## How to access
- Desktop: `mvn javafx:run` — the splash appears first, then login (or home if a session exists).
- Android: `mvn -Pandroid gluonfx:build gluonfx:package` then `gluonfx:install gluonfx:nativerun`.
- Edit colors in one place: `src/main/resources/com/bofo/finder/bofo.css` (top `.root` block).
- Preview the splash alone: in `Main.start`, temporarily skip the `Async.run(...)` call and just keep `Nav.show(splash, false)`.

## If a problem occurs (quick fixes)
| Problem | Fix |
|---|---|
| Build error in `Mascot.java` ("variable might not have been initialized") | Make sure both branches of the `if (white)` block in the constructor assign all 7 colors. |
| `Mascot.circle(...)` error | The method now takes 4 arguments (`cx, cy, r, color`). Update any other call you added. |
| Splash is not purple / unstyled | Confirm `bofo.css` is on the classpath (`Main` adds it) and the root node has style class `splash`. Run `mvn clean javafx:run`. |
| Mascot does not jump | The animation starts when the splash joins a Scene. Check `Nav.show(splash, false)` is called after `stage.show()`. |
| Old amber / old colors still visible | Run `mvn clean` (stale resources), then search for hard-coded colors: `grep -rn "#FFB400\|#6C3FC5" src`. |
| Emojis/tags look cramped on a card | Adjust `.tag` padding or font size in `bofo.css`. |
| Splash feels too long or short | Change `2200` in `Main.java` (milliseconds). |
| Want the old look back | Restore `bofo.css`, `SplashView.java` from your git history (`git checkout -- <file>`). |
